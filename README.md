Try to be the king of the hill!!!

## Intended path

### Get shell

- Use LFI to RCE in `index.php`
- Forge session in `filebrowser.php` (PHP easy deserialization) and upload `.htaccess` to bypass
- 5 byte command to FULL RCE by üçä (<https://github.com/orangetw/My-CTF-Web-Challenges/tree/master/hitcon-ctf-2017/babyfirst-revenge>)

### Get root

- find SUID (<https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/find>)
- SUID custom systemd-info for path hijacking
- Abuse sudo less gtfobins (<https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/less/>)

## Persistence

- Persistent reverse shell
- Kill other pid
- php.ini / apache config for backdoors, patches (Can restart the service)
- ...There's way more for you to discover!

## Remark

Since upload is too EZ I added an "anti-virus" to kill webshells in the middle of the game.

...Actually it's just yara scan, rule: <https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base/blob/4d54d52962aba625443d8562e59ce49cfd6984ae/yara/gen_webshells.yar>

...Which is pretty easy to bypass the rules, I think only using static string rules to detect webshells is just not enough

See [scan.sh](scan.sh) for more details.

## Environment

`docker compose up -d` should be fine

uploads, sandbox folder is mounted in so make it writeable for all users

systemd-info needs to be suid
